## 🧮 Numerology Calculation Process

The app implements traditional numerology calculation methods:

### 1. Life Path Number

- **Input**: Full date of birth (DD/MM/YYYY)
- **Process**: Reduce day, month, and year to single digits, then sum and reduce again
- **Example**: 15/03/1990 → 6+3+9 = 18 → 1+8 = 9

### 2. Expression Number

- **Input**: Full name
- **Process**: Convert each letter to its numerological value (A=1, B=2... I=9, J=1...)
- **Sum**: All letter values and reduce to single digit

### 3. Soul Urge Number

- **Input**: Full name (vowels only)
- **Process**: Same as Expression but only counting vowels (A, E, I, O, U)

### 4. Personality Number

- **Input**: Full name (consonants only)
- **Process**: Same as Expression but only counting consonants

### 5. Birthday Number

- **Input**: Day of birth
- **Process**: Reduce day number to single digit
